## My process

I used NextJS with a mobile first approach. First thing was breaking down the page into components, then I focused on layout and responsiveness to start before moving on to styling.

### Built with

- Tailwind
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

This project taught me a lot about TypeScript and React. I learned how to better approach components, use contexts, create custom types, and improved my CSS.

### Continued development

I want to continue to learn how to create scalable applications with React. Contexts made this project so much easier so I want to improve my usage of them.

CSS is always something that I want to continue to practice so I avoid adding useless styles and can make my components as simple as possible.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - They have great docs and it makes it very easy to pick up.
